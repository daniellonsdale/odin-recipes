HTML recipes project for TOP

In this project, I intend to practice the basics of HTML by creating an index page with links to a few recipes. Please see https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes for more details.

Reflections:
- I should have standardized a format and used that as the basis for the three pages rather than copying the whole page over each time
- I should have been able to make this little project more quickly than I did
- I was able to effectively practice all of the HTML I have learned through TOP up until now
